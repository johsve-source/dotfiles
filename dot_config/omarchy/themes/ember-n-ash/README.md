# Ember n Ash Theme

A warm, smoky aesthetic — deep charcoals and ashy grays kissed with soft ember light.
Designed for those who want their desktop to feel like glowing coals in a fading hearth.

## Design Notes
- **Subtle warmth**: Low-saturation ember tones that never overpower
- **Smoky depth**: Dark grays with just a hint of brown for richness
- **Eyes at ease**: Muted contrast for long sessions without strain
- **One vision, everywhere**: Consistent palette across terminal, bar, lock screen, and notifications
